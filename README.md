Regression is like trying to draw a straight line through a bunch of dots on a piece of paper.

Imagine you have a piece of paper with a bunch of dots on it, and you want to draw a straight line through them. You could try to draw the line by eye, but it might not be very accurate. Instead, you could use a ruler or a piece of string to help you draw the line as straight as possible.

In regression, a computer program is like the ruler or string, and the dots on the paper are called "data points". The program tries to draw a straight line through the data points to show how they're related.

For example, if you had data points that showed how much it rained each day and how many plants grew as a result, regression could help you draw a line that shows how much the plants grew based on how much it rained. The line could help you make predictions about how much the plants would grow if it rained a certain amount in the future.
